# ReactTutorial

Following a pluralsight tutorial by Tony Alicea React and Flux for Angular Devs.

Notes: 

React seems to try to pull the server side code out of the client environment. 
Odly enough it also mixes the webpage structure into the scripts. 







Notes from Netflix Blog React for tvs

- Higher order Components (dig deeper)
- Re listen to the video for more performance knowledge. These guys seem to know their stuff.
